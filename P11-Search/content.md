Let's take a look at adding a search bar to our `Dasboard Scene`.

[action]
See if you can add a `Search Bar` to your `Dashboard Scene` yourself.

Much like our TableView we will need a `UISearchBar` `IBOutlet` to connect our search object to our controller code and we will be creating a new extension
to implement the search delegate `UISearchBarDelegate`.

We will then implement a state system into our `NoteViewController` for displaying notes normally (DefaultMode) and how to display when we are utilizing search (SearchMode)

Let's add this outlet and display states.

[action]
Ensure the start of your `NotesViewController` looks as follows:

	class NotesViewController: UIViewController {

      @IBOutlet weak var searchBar: UISearchBar!
      @IBOutlet weak var tableView: UITableView!

      enum State {
        case DefaultMode
        case SearchMode
      }

      var state: State = .DefaultMode

[action]
1. Connect your Search Bar in your interface to the `searchBar` outlet.
2. Set the `Search Bar Delegate`, you can do this as you did before with `tableView` e.g. `searchBar.delegate = self` however
you can also do it by opening the *Connections Inspector* for the `Search Bar` object and dragging the delegate outlet to the `Dashboard`

Let's add some search functionality, Realm can use `NSPredicate` to filter it's result set. `NSPredicate` allows you to construct logical conditions used to constrain a search.
It's easier to see it in action.

[action]
Add the following function to the `NotesViewController` class:

    func searchNotes(searchString: String) -> RLMResults {
      let searchPredicate = NSPredicate(format: "title CONTAINS[c] %@ OR content CONTAINS[c] %@", searchString, searchString)
      return Note.objectsWithPredicate(searchPredicate)
    }

This should be fairly clear to read, if the string in the search bar is found in either the title or content of a note, then return that note as part of the result set.

**Search Delegate**
Now we need our app to know when we are modifying our search bar, this is where the `UISearchBarDelegate` comes into play, add the follow extension to the `NotesViewController`

    extension NotesViewController: UISearchBarDelegate {

      func searchBarTextDidBeginEditing(searchBar: UISearchBar) {
        state = .SearchMode
      }

      func searchBarCancelButtonClicked(searchBar: UISearchBar) {
        state = .DefaultMode
      }

      func searchBar(searchBar: UISearchBar, textDidChange searchText: String) {
        notes = searchNotes(searchText)
      }

    }

Run your App, pretty nice eh? Although the search works well, however the experience could be better.  Let's tidy this up.

**State Manager**

When our `Dashboard` is presented we want to revert to `.DefaultMode`.

[action]
Ensure your `func viewWillAppear` now looks as follows:

    override func viewWillAppear(animated: Bool) {
      super.viewWillAppear(animated)
      state = .DefaultMode
    }

So we are setting the default state however nothing will happen unless we use the handy *didSet* functionality to perform actions when `state` is updated.

[action]
Ensure your `state` variable definition looks as follows:

    var state: State = .DefaultMode {
        didSet {
            // update notes and search bar whenever State changes
            switch (state) {
            case .DefaultMode:
                notes = Note.allObjects().sortedResultsUsingProperty("modificationDate", ascending: false) //1
                self.navigationController!.setNavigationBarHidden(false, animated: true) //2
                searchBar.resignFirstResponder() // 3
                searchBar.text = ""
                searchBar.showsCancelButton = false
            case .SearchMode:
                let searchText = searchBar?.text ?? ""
                searchBar.setShowsCancelButton(true, animated: true) //4
                notes = searchNotes(searchText) //5
                self.navigationController!.setNavigationBarHidden(true, animated: true) //6
            }
        }
    }

- 1) We have moved our default date search code so whenever we return to default state we want to ensure the list is reset.
- 2) This returns the navigation bar in an animated fashion, you can see why it was hidden in point 6
- 3) Remove keyboard popup
- 4) Animate in a cancel button beside the search bar (UI Polish)
- 5) Perform search on any text entered in search bar
- 6) This makes the search bar take prominence in our view, by hiding the navigation bar the user is focused on search. (UI Polish)

Run the App again, looking good!

Once again a good time to commit your code.

Well done you have made it this far and have a fully functional Notes application.  Sure it may not be super pretty and polished yet
however it's your first App and a great starting place in your development.

The next chapter is on polish, we will look at changing the color of various elements to put your own stamp on it.
